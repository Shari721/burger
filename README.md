# burger

My burger app is a restaurant app that will let the user input what kind of burger they would like to eat and then devour it.

A user submits the burger name into the text box and the burger they enter is waiting to be eaten. Once the user clicks "devour" the burger will be put into a list of burgers that have been eaten by the user.
